            What is a Cybersecurity?
            Cybersecurity awareness is the understanding of online threats and the knowledge to protect yourself and your organization,
             by practicing safe online habits. It involves being aware of risks like phishing, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication,
             and keeping software updated. Since this project only involves three cyber problems including MALWARE INFECTIONS, WEAK PASSWORDS and SOCIAL ENGINEERING,
             it's only written for those three problems and its own solutions.

        <br>
        <p>So let's break them down: </p>
